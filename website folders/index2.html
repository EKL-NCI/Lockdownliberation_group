		<!--Section with music recommendations for studying more efficiently-->

		<h3>Studying with music</h3>
		
		<p>We have found that certain types of music can really aid people in focusing on their work better. We would recommend the type of music to be calming or soothing, something that could relax your mind and allow you to think straight without making any more distractions for your brain while you are studying. Here is a playlist we think is a good example of something you might listen to while studying. We hope it helps!</p>
